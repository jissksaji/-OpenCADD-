## üìë Overview

This pipeline identifies potential **EGFR inhibitors** by applying **machine learning-based screening** followed by **docking and off-target analysis**. The workflow starts with **compound filtering** based on pIC50 values, separating actives and inactives. MACCS and Morgan fingerprints are used to train **Random Forest and Neural Network models**, with **Random Forest outperforming PyTorch‚Äôs neural network**. The final model undergoes **Stratified K-Fold cross-validation**, ensuring robustness.

Filtered compounds are **clustered using Butina**, selecting diverse candidates. The **Lipinski rule of 5** ensures drug-like properties. Finally, **AutoDock Vina** performs docking, selecting the top **three compounds** based on binding affinity. Off-target interactions are predicted via **SwissTargetPrediction**, ensuring selectivity. The original report (without PyTorch implementation) is available in the `final_report` folder.
